{title:All My Tears}
{st:Julie Miller}

[Dm]When I go don't cry for me
[C]In my fathers arms I'll [Dm]be
The wounds this world left on my soul
Will all be healed and I'll be whole

Sun and moon will be replaced
With the light of Jesus' face
And I will not be ashamed
For my savior knows my name

{soc}
It don't [F]matter where you bury [Dm]me
[F]I'll be home and [C]I'll be [Dm]free
It don't [F]matter where I [Dm]lay
[C]All my tears be washed [Dm]away
{eoc}


Gold and silver blind the eye
Temporary riches lie
Come and eat from heaven's store
Come and drink and thirst no more
	
So weep not for me my friend
When my time below does end
For my life belongs to him
Who will raise the dead again
