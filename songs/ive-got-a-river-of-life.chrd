{title: I've Got A River of Life}
{st: traditional?}

[D]I've got a river of life
Flowing out of me
It [G]makes the lame to walk
And the [E]blind to [A]see
[D]Opens prison doors
Sets the captives free
[G]I've got a river of life
Flow[G]ing [A]out of [D]me

{soc}
Spring up, oh [D]well
Within my soul
Spring up, oh [D]well 
And make me [E]whole[A]
Spring up, oh [D]well 
And give to [D]me
that [G]life[A], abundant[D]ly
