{title:Got Me}
{st:She and Him}

[C]Saw your face, 
my hand you took
Just like in a story book
And you [F]got me, 
Yeah you'v[C]e got me

I can't even argue 
couldn't cause it's true
Now, you've [F]got me 
yeah, you've [C]got me

{soc}
[D]Got me tucked up in your pocket
Don't know how you won my heart
'Cause I [G]locked it, Yeah I locked it
{soc}
	
I can feel your heartbeat
Where I lay my head
'Cause you've got me
Yeah you've got me
