[Em]Summertime,
and the livin' is easy
[Am7]Fish are jumpin' 
and the [Em]cotton is [B7]high [C7] [B7]
[Em]Your daddy's rich,
and your momma's good lookin'
So [G]hush little baby,
[C7]don't [B7]you [Em]cry

One of these mornings,
you're gonna rise up singing
Then you'll spread your wings
and you'll take to the sky
But till that morning,
there's a nothin' can harm you
With daddy and mommy
by your side
