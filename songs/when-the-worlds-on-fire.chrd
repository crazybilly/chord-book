Oh, my loving [G]mother, 
when the world's on [D]fire,
don't you want God's [A]bosom 
to be your [D]pillow?
Tide me [G]over in the Rock of [D]Ages 
Rock of [A]Ages cleft for [D]me.

I'm going to heaven...

Oh, my loving brother...

Oh, my loving sinner...

Don't you want to go to heaven...
